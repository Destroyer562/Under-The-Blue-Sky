# Under-The-Blue-Sky
Actual Name for the School Game????

It may be a just a large map, or procedurally generated. What doesnt matter is that I want the enviorments look cool, and that it is a fun game. I would prefer not
to have to do character modeling, but I will do it if it is needed.

THis Github Page, is for the accumilation of any code, if there is any required that this game needs.
